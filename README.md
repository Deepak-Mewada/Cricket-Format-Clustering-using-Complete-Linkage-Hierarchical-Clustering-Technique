# Cricket-Format-Clustering-using-Complete-Linkage-Hierarchical-Clustering-Technique
CSE Machine Learning Project | Semester Mini Project

### Objective:
Consider the batting data of a batsman in a cricket match. His score has features like runs scored, ball faced,
dot balls faced, fours scored and sixes scored. You have to cluster these scores into formats of cricket
matches say Test cricket, One day cricket or Twenty-twenty. Please note that the scoring pattern of the
batsmen in different kinds of cricket formats are different. We are creative with our data and there is a
possibility of more than three known formats in our data.
Task is to cluster the dataset into an optimal number of clusters.
